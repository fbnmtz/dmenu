# Allow Color font

## Description

By default dmenu will block using colour fonts because a bug in libXft [will cause dmenu to crash][bug]. However, if you build it against a [patched version of libXft][patch] it will work fine, but you need to remove the special condition in dmenu.

This simple patch removes that check, so colour fonts work.

Again, if you don't patch libXft then dmenu will  *crash* .
